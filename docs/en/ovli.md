&nbsp;

The OVLI drone is a quadcopter (i.e., a helicopter with four propellers), equipped with an autopilot board with accelerometer, gyroscope and GPS sensors that allow fully autonomous flight.

The OVLI has a has a payload capacity enough for a high-resolution RGB camera, multi-spectral camera, or other sensors. Operation using a camera with CHDK software allows for high-quality, high-resolution reproducible image capture suitable for reaserch purposes. With a maximum flight time of 15 minutes, the OVLI drone is capable of performing a wide range of mapping missions. Operation can be done through a manually operated radio controller, but for research purposes it is usually convenient to fly the drone autonomously using a pre-programmed flight plan. The drone follows this plan while capturing images, and information on its position, battery voltage, altitude, speed, etc. can be viewed live using its ground station software.

The OVLI is based on free and open source hardware and software, which allows the user to inspect all its components or customize it for different applications. “OVLI” is an acronym for “Objeto Volador Libre”, which means “Free Flying Object” in Spanish.
